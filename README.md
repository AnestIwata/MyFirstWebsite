##                                                          Welcome! 

  My name is **Pawel Pelech** and I have created this website to showcase my work in fields of amateur photography and film-making. Most of my 
  work was done as a pure hobby, however I do have some successful commercial work under my belt. There is information about me, who I am and 
  what I do. In gear  page section all the aspects of my equipment are covered. Lastly for potential customers contact page is being created. 
  A links to social media are provided for further possibility of cooperation.

##  Technologies used:
  
  1. **HTML**
  2. **CSS**
  3. **Bootstrap (3.3.7)**
  4. **JavaScrip**

## Testing:

  Under news section they are buttons to related articles. If pressed they will open up a new tab with related article. 
  Bootstrap framework was used to create contact page. If you try to submit the contact form without email address, there will be an message showing the invalid email address.
  The 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so these are necessary to submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload.

  All the navbar buttons will open related page. My logo when clicked will open up homepage.

  I have tried to implement **Fancybox** framework in this project. The purpose of the feature was supposed to be simple. In picture gallery
  every photograph clicked should go to full screen mode. Unfortunately that feature didn't work correctly. Photo when clicked was going full 
  screen, but after closing it was disapering from gallery. This issue was addressed my me to Code Institute support. 

  The site is fully responsive in different devices. All the layout stays clean and readable via all assortment of view ports.
  One of most important features is a navbar menu going to hamburger button on smaller devices. When clicked it opens up buttons to
  related pages.

  All the gallery items rearrange according to screen size.

## Features:

  News feed. User is provided with a news tabs. They contain sports and equipment related news topics. When clicked they will open up an article.
  Extensive gallery of my images and videos. 
  Information about equipment I use.
  Contact form . Filled out provides direct contact with me. 

## Features to implement:

  Make Fancybox gallery functional.

##  Deployment:
  The deployment process was divided between two repositories .First one is hosted [here] https://github.com/AnestIwata/MilestoneOne. From second and final repository the website is deployed. 
  This site is will be hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically when new commits are made to the master branch.
  In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing must be named `index.html` and have a "README.md". 

  To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/AnestIwata/Milestone.git` into your IDE.
